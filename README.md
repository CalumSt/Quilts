This a place for me to upload the source and most-up-to-date builds of the plugins I make. They aren't for commercial release, and are for documentation purposes, and so I can record my notes on what I want from it, what I've learned, and things I'd like to do or come back to.

Current plugins:
  Decimator (Bitcrusher)
